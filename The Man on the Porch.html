<h>Lyrics to "The Man on the Porch"</h>

<h>There lives a man</h>
<h>In the middle of nowhere -</h>
<h>Isolated.<h>

    <br>
    
<h>Dry wind blows across the arid land.</h>
<h>A wooden house.</h>
<h>Battered and beaten -</h> 
<h>A spirit to match.</h>

    <br>
    
<h>There he sits, always looking out.</h>
<h>He seems.. distant,</h>
<h>A shell of his former self.</h>
<h>No one knows his story -</h> 
<h>Not a single soul able to reach him.</h>
<h>Questions unanswered.</h>

    <br>
    
<h>There are rumors of course:</h>
<h>A man chased out by unfortunate circumstance,</h>
<h>A girl in the woods,</h> 
<h>Battered and bruised -</h>
<h>Accused of the misdeed.</h>

    <br>
    
<h>Some say it was the war.</h>
A man backed into a corner by those he fought for,</h>
Driven mad, into desolation.<h>

    <br>
    
<h>Others say he once loved -</h>
<h>A tragic accident that befell his beloved.</h>

    <br>
    
<h>Each day, a new story.</h>
<h>Nothing joyous.</h>
<h>Just a man, now seemingly molded by fear, grief, and anger.</h>

    <br>
    
<h>No matter the time,</h>
<h>No matter the day,</h>
<h>There will always be</h>
<h>The man who sits on his porch.</h>
