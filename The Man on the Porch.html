<h>
There lives a man
In the middle of nowhere -
Isolated.<h>

<h>Dry wind blows across the arid land.
A wooden house. 
Battered and beaten - 
A spirit to match.</h>

<h>There he sits, always looking out.
He seems.. distant,
A shell of his former self.
No one knows his story - 
Not a single soul able to reach him.
Questions unanswered.</h>

<h>There are rumors of course:
A man chased out by unfortunate circumstance,
A girl in the woods, 
Battered and bruised -
Accused of the misdeed.</h>

<h>Some say it was the war.
A man backed into a corner by those he fought for,
Driven mad, into desolation.<h>

<h>Others say he once loved -
A tragic accident that befell his beloved.</h>

<h>Each day, a new story.
Nothing joyous.
Just a man, now seemingly molded by fear, grief, and anger.</h>

<h>No matter the time,
No matter the day,
There will always be
The man who sits on his porch.</h>
