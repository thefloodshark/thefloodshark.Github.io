<h1><u>Wind in My Sails</h1></u>

Puff wind in my sails
As all shallow swales yield mighty gales,
And sad, sing-song tales of sea.

Find me on a sunny day,
With flower in ear
End April comes Mæy,
With nothing but fear to fear
And seas to see.

Find me lost at sea
Abandoned, shipwrecked,
Separate from thee.

Or find us, you and me,
On this island in this tree,
High above the sadly seas.

Let’s set sail, you and me,
O’er the seas of time.
And when all else fails,
Puff wind in my sails.
